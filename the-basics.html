      <p class="secondary-stories" id="one">In France, Joseph Marie Jacquard invents
          <br> a loom that uses punched wooden cards
        <br> to automatically weave fabric designs. 
        <br>Early computers would use similar punch cards.

      <p class="secondary-stories">1822: English mathematician Charles Babbage 
          <br>conceives of a steam-driven calculating machine that would
          <br> be able to compute tables of numbers. The project, funded 
          <br>by the English government, is a failure. More than a century 
          <br>later, however, the world's first computer was actually built.
